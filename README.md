GRAMPS addon to check a person's ancestors against FamilySearch

The tool will start from the active person and look for a FamilySearch link in the Internet attributes.
If found it will access the FS information, determine correlation between the two (work in progress),
get the parents, and recurse upwards until corresponding parents in FS or the local databse are not
available. There will be an option to limit the number of generations searched. There is code to add
a missing local person after confirmation.
